- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

The answer is no. While it is possible to create multiple constructors with the same name in Java, it is not allowed if the data types of the parameters are the same. In this case, since both "title" and "category" have the same data type (String), it would result in a compilation error.
