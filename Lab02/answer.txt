Question: 
-Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
In Java, when you pass a primitive data type (such as int, float, double) to a method, it is passed by value. This means that a copy of the value is passed to the method and any changes made to that value within the method do not affect the original value outside the method.

On the other hand, when you pass an object reference to a method in Java, it is passed by value as well. This means that a copy of the reference to the object is passed to the method and any changes made to the object within the method will affect the original object outside the method. However, the reference itself remains unchanged.
